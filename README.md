I love music.
I found that when I was learning to code, I spent almost no time looking and listening to new music, it was all stuff that had been on my Spotify for a while.

I built this project to solve that. It gets new music for me, from a website which contains new releases for what I like to listen to.
It then makes a new playlist for me in Spotify and places all the tracks there.

Whilst not the most complex project, it has a place close to my heart as it was the first one to solve a real issue that I had.
